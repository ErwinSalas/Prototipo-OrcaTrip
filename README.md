Project Description

OrcaTrip is a tool that allows the visualization of maps with information of places with greater probability of Orcas sighting. We combine for our users data that are currently scattered or nonexistent. Our expert users will be able to record sightings and combine information from the layers of data we provide, generating customized maps.
